⚠️ **Note: This is a Toy Project** ⚠️

The primary purpose of this project is to help me get started with and understand the basic concepts of **Graph Neural Networks**. As a result, the implementation is quite simple and may not be fully polished. If you find the project too basic or the code a bit rough, please bear with me.

This project contains implementations of various graph network models. More common graph network models will be gradually implemented and uploaded.

## Implemented Models

### 1. GNN

**Karate Club Classifier**

A basic GNN framework is implemented to classify the nodes in the Karate Club dataset, assigning each member to one of the two clubs based on the graph structure.
### 2. GCN

**Cora Classifier**

A GCN model is implemented for node classification in the Cora dataset, classifying each paper in the academic citation network by its topic.

### 3. GAT

**Cora Classifer**

Using a random seed, the highest test accuracy achieved on the Cora dataset through the GAT model and parameter tuning is **82.3%**.
